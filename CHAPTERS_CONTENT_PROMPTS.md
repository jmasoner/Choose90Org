### Prompt 1: "Start a Chapter" Landing Page Strategy

**Goal:** Create compelling copy to convince someone to start a chapter.

**Prompt:**

>
> Please write:
>
> 1. **A Hero Headline** (Short, punchy, inspiring).
> 2. **3 Key Benefits** of hosting (e.g., curing your own loneliness, being a beacon of light, doing something real vs online).
> 3. **A 'How It Works' Section** (3 simple steps: Apply, Get the Kit, Host at a Coffee Shop).
> 4. **A FAQ Section** answering: 'Do I need to be an expert?', 'How much time does it take?', and 'Is there a cost?' (Answer: No expert needed, just a facilitator. 1 hour a month. Free.)"
