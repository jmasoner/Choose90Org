# How to Open Another Chat with Grok in Cursor

## Quick Steps

### Step 1: Open New Chat Window
1. **Keyboard Shortcut:**
   - Press `Ctrl+L` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+L` (Mac)
   - OR `Ctrl+Shift+L` for a new chat tab

2. **UI Method:**
   - Look for the `+` button in the chat panel
   - OR click "New Chat" in the chat sidebar
   - OR go to View menu → New Chat

3. **Menu Method:**
   - File → New → Chat Window (if available)

### Step 2: Switch to Grok (if using Cursor's AI switching)
- Look for AI model selector in the chat interface
- Select "Grok" or "xAI" if available
- Note: Cursor may only support one AI model per workspace
- If Grok isn't available, you can still use the current AI (me) in the new window

### Step 3: Share Context with New Chat
Once you have a new chat open:

1. **Reference the CRM documents:**
   - Type: "Please read CRM_SYSTEM_PLAN.md"
   - OR copy/paste the contents of `CRM_PROMPT_FOR_GROK.md`

2. **Give context:**
   - "I'm working on Choose90.org, a WordPress-based nonprofit site"
   - "I need a CRM system for chapter communications"
   - "See CRM_SYSTEM_PLAN.md for detailed requirements"

3. **Start the work:**
   - Share the prompt from `CRM_PROMPT_FOR_GROK.md`
   - Ask Grok to start with Phase 1 MVP design

## Alternative: Use Grok in Browser

If Cursor doesn't support switching AI models, you can:

1. **Open Grok in your browser:**
   - Go to https://x.ai (if you have access)
   - OR use Grok in another AI tool

2. **Copy the CRM prompt:**
   - Open `CRM_PROMPT_FOR_GROK.md`
   - Copy the entire prompt
   - Paste it into Grok

3. **Share project context:**
   - Copy relevant parts of `CRM_SYSTEM_PLAN.md`
   - Share file structures if needed
   - Reference specific technical requirements

## What I'll Continue Working On

While you set up Grok, I'll continue here with:
- Chapter improvements (meta fields, search, etc.)
- Any other tasks you need
- Ready to help coordinate when Grok has questions

## Sharing Files Between Chats

Both chats can access the same project files:
- Both see the same workspace
- Both can read/write files
- Git commits are shared
- Just coordinate if both are editing the same file

## Tips

- **Name your chats:** Cursor may let you name chat tabs - "Chapters Work" and "CRM Development"
- **Switch easily:** Use Ctrl+1, Ctrl+2, etc. to switch between chat tabs
- **Share progress:** You can copy Grok's output and share it here if needed
- **Coordinate:** If both need to edit the same file, do it sequentially
