## ✨ What is Choose90?

Choose90 is a personal movement to make **90% of your online influence positive, uplifting, and constructive**.  
Not perfect. Not fake. Just intentional.

## 🌱 Why It Matters

Every day, our words shape the spaces we’re in.  
When we choose encouragement over outrage, clarity over chaos, and kindness over conflict, we make the internet — and our communities — better places.

## 🤝 What Choose90 Is NOT

- Not political  
- Not a performance  
- Not about pretending life is perfect  
- Not about judging anyone  

It’s simply choosing to let the *majority* of your influence reflect the best version of you.
