  *   SSH keys provide a more secure way to connect to GitHub without re-entering your username and password repeatedly.
    ```powershell
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "john@masoner.us"
    ```
    *   When prompted, press `Enter` to accept the default file location (`C:\Users\john\.ssh\id_ed25519`).
    *   Optionally, enter a strong passphrase (and confirm it) for added security. If you don't want a passphrase, just press `Enter` twice.
    *   **Add your SSH key to the ssh-agent:**
        ```powershell
        Get-Service ssh-agent | Set-Service -StartupType Automatic # Ensure ssh-agent starts automatically
        Start-Service ssh-agent # Start the service if not running
        ssh-add C:\Users\john\.ssh\id_ed25519
        Write-Host "SSH key generated and added to ssh-agent."
        ```
