# Event Landing Page Placement Strategy

## 🎯 Current Placement

### **New Year's Resolution:**
- ✅ Pledge dropdown → "New Year's Resolution"
- ✅ Resources > Special Events → "New Year's Resolution"

### **Kwanzaa & Choose90:**
- ✅ Resources > Special Events → "Kwanzaa & Choose90"

## 💡 Recommended Strategy

### **Option 1: Homepage Featured Section** ⭐ RECOMMENDED
**Why:** Maximum visibility, drives traffic to seasonal campaigns
- Add "Featured Campaigns" section on homepage
- Large, eye-catching cards for each event
- Auto-hide when event ends (or keep as archive)

### **Option 2: Top Announcement Banner**
**Why:** Non-intrusive but always visible
- Thin banner at top of site (below header)
- Rotates between active campaigns
- Dismissible (cookie-based)
- Links directly to event pages

### **Option 3: Keep Current + Enhance**
**Why:** Already accessible, just needs prominence
- Keep in Resources > Special Events
- Add prominent links on homepage
- Add to footer "Quick Links"

## 🚫 Why NOT a Separate "Events" Menu?

1. **Navigation Clutter** - Main nav already has 7 items
2. **Low Volume** - Only 2 events currently
3. **Seasonal** - Events come and go, menu items should be permanent
4. **Better UX** - Homepage features get more clicks than menu items

## ✅ Final Recommendation

**Multi-Location Approach:**
1. **Homepage Hero Section** - Featured campaigns (most visible)
2. **Top Banner** - Seasonal announcement (always visible)
3. **Resources > Special Events** - Keep for discovery
4. **Footer** - Quick links section

This gives maximum exposure without cluttering navigation.
