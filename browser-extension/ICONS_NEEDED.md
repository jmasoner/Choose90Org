# Extension Icons Needed

The browser extension needs icons in three sizes. You can create these using any image editor or online tool.

## Required Icons

Create these files in the `icons/` folder:

1. **icon16.png** - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
2. **icon48.png** - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
3. **icon128.png** - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Design Suggestions

- Use the Choose90 logo or brand colors
- Gradient: #667eea to #764ba2 (purple/blue)
- Include "90" or "Choose90" text if readable at small sizes
- Keep it simple and recognizable

## Quick Creation Options

1. **Online Tools:**
   - [Favicon Generator](https://favicon.io/)
   - [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) - create 128x128, then resize

2. **Using Existing Assets:**
   - Check `hybrid_site/` for logo files
   - Resize to required dimensions

3. **Temporary Placeholders:**
   - For testing, you can use any 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG images
   - The extension will work without proper icons, but they'll look unprofessional

## For Now

The extension will work without icons, but Chrome will show a default puzzle piece icon. Create proper icons before publishing to the Chrome Web Store.
