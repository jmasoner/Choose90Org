# Choose90 Extension Video Demo - Tools & Options

## User Request
Create a video showing how the Choose90 browser extension works, what it looks like, and how it gives you your original content and then the Choose90 spin content on the left and allows you to choose which to post.

## Available Options

### Option 1: Detailed Script/Storyboard ✅ (Selected)
I can create a detailed, step-by-step script with timing, narration, and visual descriptions that you or a video creator can use to produce the video.

### Option 2: Interactive Demo Page
I can build an HTML page that simulates the extension experience, showing:
- A fake social media post interface
- The extension popup appearing
- Side-by-side comparison (original vs. rewritten)
- The selection interface

This can be used as a reference for a video or embedded on the site.

### Option 3: Video Creation Tools Recommendations
- **Screen recording**: OBS Studio (free), Loom, or built-in screen recorders
- **AI video tools**: Synthesia, D-ID, or RunwayML for AI-generated videos
- **Simple animations**: Canva, Powtoon, or Adobe Express

### Option 4: Step-by-Step Visual Guide
I can build an HTML page with:
- Screenshots placeholders with descriptions
- Animated transitions showing the flow
- Interactive elements demonstrating the process

## Recommendation
Option 2 (Interactive Demo Page) is recommended as a quick way to show the functionality, and you can record it later or use it as a reference for a professional video.
