🎉 **Happy Kwanzaa!** 

This year, I'm honoring the Nguzo Saba (the 7 principles) through a special 7-day Choose90 challenge.

Each day, I'll focus on one principle and complete an action—both online and offline—that embodies it:
- Day 1: Umoja (Unity)
- Day 2: Kujichagulia (Self-Determination)
- Day 3: Ujima (Collective Work & Responsibility)
- Day 4: Ujamaa (Cooperative Economics)
- Day 5: Nia (Purpose)
- Day 6: Kuumba (Creativity)
- Day 7: Imani (Faith)

This isn't about perfection. It's about **purpose**. It's about choosing to reflect the best of who we are, especially when the world needs it most.

## Template 4: LinkedIn Post

**Title:** Honoring Kwanzaa Through Intentional Positive Influence

**Post:**

This Kwanzaa season, I'm doing something different: a 7-day challenge that connects the Nguzo Saba (the seven principles of Kwanzaa) with Choose90—a movement to make 90% of our online influence positive, uplifting, and constructive.

Each day focuses on one principle:
- **Umoja (Unity):** Building bridges, not walls
- **Kujichagulia (Self-Determination):** Taking control of our narrative
- **Ujima (Collective Work & Responsibility):** Lifting each other up
- **Ujamaa (Cooperative Economics):** Supporting each other's success
- **Nia (Purpose):** Aligning our influence with our mission
- **Kuumba (Creativity):** Using our unique voice to inspire
- **Imani (Faith):** Believing in our community's future

This isn't about ignoring problems. It's about choosing to be part of the solution. It's about intentionality, not perfection.
