            <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #666;">50 Non-Divisive Questions for Deeper Connections</p>
        </div>

        <div class="intro">
            <h3>Why This Kit Exists</h3>
            <p>In a world where algorithms push us toward arguments and division, we need tools to build bridges. These questions are designed to create connection, not conflict. They invite stories, not debates.</p>
            <p><strong>Remember:</strong> The goal isn't to agree on everything. The goal is to understand each other better and leave feeling uplifted, not divided.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <h3>💡 How to Use These Questions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Listen to understand, not to reply.</strong> Give the person space to share fully.</li>
                <li><strong>No "yes, but..."</strong> Just listen and ask follow-up questions.</li>
                <li><strong>Share your own answer.</strong> Vulnerability builds connection.</li>
                <li><strong>Skip politics and hot-button topics.</strong> Focus on experiences and values.</li>
                <li><strong>It's okay to disagree.</strong> The goal is understanding, not agreement.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>🚫 Questions to Avoid</h3>
            <p>These topics tend to create division rather than connection:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Political candidates or parties</li>
                <li>Hot-button social issues (unless you know the person well and they're open to discussion)</li>
                <li>Religious doctrine or theological debates</li>
                <li>Controversial current events designed to provoke</li>
                <li>Anything that starts with "Don't you think..." (this invites argument)</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>Remember:</strong> The goal is connection, not conversion. We're choosing 90% positive, which means we focus on what brings us together, not what divides us.</p>
