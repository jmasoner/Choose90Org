# The 7-Day Kwanzaa Choose90 Challenge
## Based on the Nguzo Saba

---

## Overview

This challenge honors the seven principles of Kwanzaa (Nguzo Saba) by connecting each principle to intentional positive influence—both online and in your community. Each day, you'll focus on one principle and complete a specific action that embodies it.

**Remember:** Choose90 is about making 90% of your influence positive. That doesn't mean ignoring problems. It means choosing to be part of the solution.

## Day 1: Umoja (Unity)

**The Principle:** To strive for and maintain unity in the family, community, nation, and race.

**Your Challenge:**
- **Online:** Share a post that brings people together. Highlight unity in your community, family, or workplace. Share a story of people working together despite differences.
- **Offline:** Reach out to someone you haven't spoken to in a while. Have a conversation that builds connection, not division.
- **Reflection:** How can your words and actions create unity rather than division?

**Example Post:**
> "Day 1 of the Kwanzaa Choose90 Challenge: Umoja (Unity). Today I'm celebrating the ways our community comes together—whether it's supporting local businesses, volunteering together, or simply showing up for each other. Unity isn't about being the same. It's about choosing connection over division. #Kwanzaa #Choose90 #Umoja"

## Notes

- **90% doesn't mean 100%:** You're allowed to have bad days, express frustration, and be human. The goal is intentionality, not perfection.
- **This is inclusive:** While Kwanzaa is a celebration of African heritage, these principles are universal. Anyone can honor them and apply them to their life.
- **Start where you are:** You don't have to be perfect. Just be intentional. Every positive post matters.

**Happy Kwanzaa. Choose90.**
